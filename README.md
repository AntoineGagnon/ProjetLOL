### First year C# project at the IUT.

This project was made by Arnaud Jabin and myself during our first year degree at the IUT des Cezeaux in Clermont-Ferrand FRANCE

This project was given to us my [Marc Chevaldonne], our Object oriented programmation teacher as a way to practice our knowledge in C# and get a first 
feel of what it is like to make a real project. 

The aim of it was to create a Master Detail application, the theme was then for us to choose. We choose the League of Legends game as a theme as we were both players at the time and thought it was a good idea to use their universe, having loads of characters with details about them defined in the game.

#### Possible evolutions 
Adding serialization to champions and loading them from an XML file instead of raw code

Adding a parser that would be able to grab informations about champions on the League of Legends website
